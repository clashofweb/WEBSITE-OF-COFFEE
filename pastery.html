<p>The pastery we serve is all fresly made in the morning for the day ahead, and a second batch made before the midday rush to ensure we are always stocked up ready for are customes. It is all hand made, from the fresh raw ingreadients. we have several different ways of making the same items, with vegans, vegitarians, lactos itollarents, and other allergies in mind. To ensure there is no cross contaminations, we have several different sections, each with there own ingreedients and worker, to ensure that none of them are mixed. deliverlies for each station is on a different day as well for safty reasons. We can also warm up the pastery for eat in if wished for. Iin addtion every two months we put on a pastery making class for all those whom would like to enjoy freshly baked pastery at home. This can be looked into on the about page of when the next class will be held.</p>
